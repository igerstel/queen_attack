Queen Attack Problem, by Ian Gerstel

After unzipping the files, make sure Ruby 2.4.0 and a bundler gem is available, and run 'bundle install' to set up RSpec. From there, tests can be run with 'rspec', and the program is run with 'ruby queen'.

The program will ask for two pairs of coordinates (1-8), representing the row and column squares for the White Queen and Black Queen positions on a chess board. Coordinate 1,1 represents the top left square.

The program outputs whether or not the queens can capture one another given those positions.
